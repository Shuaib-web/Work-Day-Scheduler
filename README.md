# Work-Day-Scheduler

At the point when the planner is opened the present date is shown at the top of the page. At the point when you look down you are given time blocks for every hours of the functioning day. Time blocks are colour coordinated to show depending on the hour if it has already passed, if it is present and if the hour still hasn't arrived yet. The colours will refresh as the day goes on. A client can tap on a period block and add text. At the point when text is added a save button will show and the client can save their entrance. Everything that is saved is sent to a  nearby storage and continue when the page is refreshed or shut down.
